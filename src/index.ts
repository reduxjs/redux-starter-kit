// Unfortunately, Babel's TypeScript plugin doesn't let us re-export
// types using the `export { ... } from` syntax. Because it compiles
// modules, independently, it has no way of knowing whether an identifier
// refers to a type or value, and thus cannot strip the type re-exports
// out of the generated JS.
//
// https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8361
//
// As a workaround, the root of this repository contains an `index.d.ts`
// that contains all type re-exports. Whenever adding a new public function
// or type, remember to export it in `index.d.ts` as well.
