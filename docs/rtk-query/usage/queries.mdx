# Queries

This is the most basic feature of RTK Query. A query operation can be performed with any data fetching library of your choice, but the general recommendation is that you only use queries for requests that retrieve data. For anything that alters data on the server or will possibly invalidate the cache, you should use a [Mutation](./mutations).

By default, RTK Query ships with [`fetchBaseQuery`](../api/fetchBaseQuery), which is a lightweight [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) wrapper that automatically handles request headers and response parsing in a manner similar to common libraries like `axios`. See [Customizing Queries](./customizing-queries) if `fetchBaseQuery` does not handle your requirements.

> Depending on your environment, you may need to polyfill `fetch` with `node-fetch` or `cross-fetch` if you choose to use `fetchBaseQuery` or `fetch` on its own.

See [`useQuery`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usequery) for the hook signature and additional details.

```ts title="Example of all query endpoint options"
// file: types.ts noEmit
export interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}

// file: api.ts
// Or from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react'
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'
import { Post } from './types'

const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: '/',
  }),
  tagTypes: ['Post'],
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    getPost: build.query<Post, number>({
      // highlight-start
      // note: an optional `queryFn` may be used in place of `query`
      query: (id) => ({ url: `post/${id}` }),
      // Pick out data and prevent nested properties in a hook or selector
      transformResponse: (response: { data: Post }) => response.data,
      providesTags: (result, error, id) => [{ type: 'Post', id }],
      // The 2nd parameter is the destructured `QueryLifecycleApi`
      async onQueryStarted(
        arg,
        {
          dispatch,
          getState,
          extra,
          requestId,
          queryFulfilled,
          getCacheEntry,
          updateCachedData,
        }
      ) {},
      // The 2nd parameter is the destructured `QueryCacheLifecycleApi`
      async onCacheEntryAdded(
        arg,
        {
          dispatch,
          getState,
          extra,
          requestId,
          cacheEntryRemoved,
          cacheDataLoaded,
          getCacheEntry,
          updateCachedData,
        }
      ) {},
      // highlight-end
    }),
  }),
})
```

### Performing Queries with React Hooks

If you're using React Hooks, RTK Query does a few additional things for you. The primary benefit is that you get a render-optimized hook that allows you to have 'background fetching' as well as [derived booleans](#query-hook-return-types) for convenience.

Hooks are automatically generated based on the name of the `endpoint` in the service definition. An endpoint field with `getPost: builder.query()` will generate a hook named `useGetPostQuery`.

#### Hook types

There are 5 query-related hooks:

1. [`useQuery`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usequery)
   - Composes `useQuerySubscription` and `useQueryState` and is the primary hook. Automatically triggers fetches of data from an endpoint, 'subscribes' the component to the cached data, and reads the request status and cached data from the Redux store.
2. [`useQuerySubscription`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usequerysubscription)
   - Returns a `refetch` function and accepts all hook options. Automatically triggers fetches of data from an endpoint, and 'subscribes' the component to the cached data.
3. [`useQueryState`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usequerystate)
   - Returns the query state and accepts `skip` and `selectFromResult`. Reads the request status and cached data from the Redux store.
4. [`useLazyQuery`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#uselazyquery)
   - Returns a tuple with a `fetch` function, the query result, and last promise info. Similar to `useQuery`, but with manual control over when the data fetching occurs.
5. [`useLazyQuerySubscription`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#uselazyquerysubscription)
   - Returns a tuple with a `fetch` function, and last promise info. Similar to `useQuerySubscription`, but with manual control over when the data fetching occurs.

#### Query Hook Options

- [skip](./conditional-fetching) - Allows a query to 'skip' running for that render. Defaults to `false`
- [pollingInterval](./polling) - Allows a query to automatically refetch on a provided interval, specified in milliseconds. Defaults to `0` _(off)_
- [selectFromResult](#selecting-data-from-a-query-result) - Allows altering the returned value of the hook to obtain a subset of the result, render-optimized for the returned subset.
- [refetchOnMountOrArgChange](../api/createApi#refetchonmountorargchange) - Allows forcing the query to always refetch on mount (when `true` is provided). Allows forcing the query to refetch if enough time (in seconds) has passed since the last query for the same cache (when a `number` is provided). Defaults to `false`
- [refetchOnFocus](../api/createApi#refetchonfocus) - Allows forcing the query to refetch when the browser window regains focus. Defaults to `false`
- [refetchOnReconnect](../api/createApi#refetchonreconnect) - Allows forcing the query to refetch when regaining a network connection. Defaults to `false`

> All `refetch`-related options will override the defaults you may have set in [createApi](../api/createApi)

#### Frequently Used Query Hook Return Values

The query hook returns an object containing properties such as the latest `data` for the query request, as well as status booleans for the current request lifecycle state. Below are some of the most frequently used properties. Refer to [`useQuery`](../api/created-api/hooks.mdx#usequery) for an extensive list of all returned properties.

- `data` - The returned result if present.
- `error` - The error result if present.
- `isUninitialized` - When true, indicates that the query has not started yet.
- `isLoading` - When true, indicates that the query is currently loading for the first time, and has no data yet. This will be `true` for the first request fired off, but _not_ for subsequent requests.
- `isFetching` - When true, indicates that the query is currently fetching, but might have data from an earlier request. This will be `true` for both the first request fired off, as well as subsequent requests.
- `isSuccess` - When true, indicates that the query has data from a successful request.
- `isError` - When true, indicates that the query is in an `error` state.
- `refetch` - A function to force refetch the query

#### Example

Here is an example of a `PostDetail` component:

```tsx title="Example"
export const PostDetail = ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
  const { data: post, isFetching, isLoading } = useGetPostQuery(id, {
    pollingInterval: 3000,
    refetchOnMountOrArgChange: true,
    skip: false,
  })

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (!post) return <div>Missing post!</div>

  return (
    <div>
      {post.name} {isFetching ? '...refetching' : ''}
    </div>
  )
}
```

The way that this component is setup would have some nice traits:

1. It only shows 'Loading...' on the **initial load**

   - **Initial load** is defined as a query that is pending and does not have data in the cache

2. When the request is re-triggered by the polling interval, it will add '...refetching' to the post name
3. If a user closed this `PostDetail`, but then re-opened it within [the allowed time](../api/createApi#keepunuseddatafor), they would immediately be served a cached result and polling would resume with the previous behavior.

### Selecting data from a query result

Sometimes you may have a parent component that is subscribed to a query, and then in a child component you want to pick an item from that query. In most cases you don't want to perform an additional request for a `getItemById`-type query when you know that you already have the result.

`selectFromResult` allows you to get a specific segment from a query result in a performant manner. When using this feature, the component will not rerender unless the underlying data of the selected item has changed. If the selected item is one element in a larger collection, it will disregard changes to elements in the same collection.

```tsx title="Using selectFromResult to extract a single result"
function PostsList() {
  const { data: posts } = api.useGetPostsQuery()

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts?.data?.map((post) => (
        <PostById key={post.id} id={post.id} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

function PostById({ id }: { id: number }) {
  // Will select the post with the given id, and will only rerender if the given posts data changes
  const { post } = api.useGetPostsQuery(undefined, {
    selectFromResult: ({ data }) => ({
      post: data?.find((post) => post.id === id),
    }),
  })

  return <li>{post?.name}</li>
}
```

### Query Cache Keys

When you perform a query, RTK Query automatically serializes the request parameters and creates an internal `queryCacheKey` for the request. Any future request that produces the same `queryCacheKey` will be de-duped against the original, and will share updates if a `refetch` is trigged on the query from any subscribed component.

### Avoiding unnecessary requests

By default, if you add a component that makes the same query as an existing one, no request will be performed.

In some cases, you may want to skip this behavior and force a refetch - in that case, you can call `refetch` that is returned by the hook.

> If you're not using React Hooks, you can access `refetch` like this:
>
> ```ts no-transpile
> const { status, data, error, refetch } = dispatch(
>   pokemonApi.endpoints.getPokemon.initiate('bulbasaur')
> )
> ```

### Observing caching behavior

What you'll see below is this:

1. The first `Pokemon` component mounts and immediately fetches 'bulbasaur'
2. A second later, another `Pokemon` component is rendered with 'bulbasaur'

   - Notice that this one doesn't ever show 'Loading...' and no new network request happens? It's using the cache here.

3. A moment after that, a `Pokemon` component for 'pikachu' is added, and a new request happens.
4. When you click 'Refetch' of a particular pokemon type, it'll update all of them with one request.

:::note Try it out
Click the 'Add bulbasaur' button. You'll observe the same behavior described above until you click the 'Refetch' button on one of the components.
